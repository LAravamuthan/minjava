Notes:

Note that when we pass the column names on which to join  -> JoinTwoFields() => Then index is 1 based. 
But, when we are storing in the fieldtracker => we store which field is stored at what position. 
So if 
1
2
3
A
B
C

And table is like B A C => Field Tracker is : [2 1 3]
B's columns are stored, then A's columns and Then C's columns.
